## Introduction to DataSage

[DataSage.io](https://datasage.io/) is a cloud data classification and tracking product that allows enterprises to implement governance, risk, and compliance. It works on MySQL Databases at this moment of time and is database specific.

Enterprise data environments are increasingly complex. Data is spread across multiple different environments with multiple personas accessing the data. It is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible to Provide continuous visibility on data access or preventing data breaches.

DataSage is an Open Source tool that solves these problems by enabling the following features:

1. **Data Protection:** The system will identify all the data sources available and provides unprecedented "unified" visibility and policy based access control to all the data sources.

2. **Data Classification:** DataSage provides unprecedented visibility through automated data classification of known types of data (that have been defined with metadata) across all the databases it has been tracking.

3. **Data Audit:** DataSage provides continuous visibility and policy based data governance through a data policy operator.

## Background

Enterprise data environments are increasingly complex and data is now spread across multiple databases as well as environments. Sensitive data is freely copied around the enterprises with various users without clear auditing.
While traditional Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions have helped identify data exfilteration outside the enterprise, it is difficult for existing solutions to provide 

- To Provide continuous visibility on data access

- To identify and prevent data breaches from cloud data sources

- To provide continuous reporting on compliance such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC2 etc for all data sources



## DataSage Design Goals

The following are DataSage Design goals:

- Identify and classify sensitive data within various data sources automatically and continously
- Provide policy based visibility and governance
- Report on well known compliance needs
