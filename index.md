## Background

Enterprise data environments are increasingly complex and data is now spread across multiple databases as well as environments. Sensitive data is freely copied around the enterprises with various users without clear auditing.
While traditional Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions have helped identify data exfilteration outside the enterprise, it is difficult for existing solutions to provide 

- To Provide continuous visibility on data access

- To identify and prevent data breaches from cloud data sources

- To provide continuous reporting on compliance such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC2 etc for all data sources



## DataSage Design Goals

The following are DataSage Design goals:

- Identify and classify sensitive data within various data sources automatically and continously
- Provide policy based visibility and governance
- Report on well known compliance needs
